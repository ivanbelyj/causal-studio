  <h1>Causal Studio</h1>
  
  Universal solution for procedural generation tasks, related to causality.
</div>

## 🚧 Current Status
> **Under Active Development**  
> I'm currently building the core functionality with exciting progress!
> **Beta version expected:** Q4 2025

## ✨ Features
- 💻 Causal models development
- 📦 Language-independent format which can be run using the editor, CLI, programmatically (.NET Standard DLL) or [in Unity](https://github.com/ivanbelyj/CausalModelUnity)
- ⚙️ Integration with the [simulation system](https://github.com/ivanbelyj/CausalModel) - models running and probability estimation
- 🏗️ Multi-level causal models with an abstraction mechanism for complex projects (see [causal model blocks](https://github.com/ivanbelyj/CausalModel/?tab=readme-ov-file#blocks))
- 🔄 Undo/Redo • ☀️/🌙 Themes • Flexible workspace

## 🎯 Use Case Examples
Build causal models for everything
- 🎮 **Various GameDev tasks**: Procedural generation of personalities, scenarios, characteristics, parameters for generation schemas, appearances, fictional world background, etc.
- 🎨 **Generative AI**: Smart prompt engineering for stable diffusion/LLMs
- 💬 **Dialog Systems**: Context-aware response output
- 📊 **Realistic Simulations**: Systems obeying statistical constraints
- 🎲 **Probability Analysis**: Fact likelihoods from causal models
